## Life is succession of challenges... ##
#### ... that we face on a daily basis : ####

 - Most part of those are easy to overcome, and are completed in a matter of seconds,
 - But some will appear overwhelming, and will take much time to achieve !

#### *With such assessment, we can agree that everybody need some waypoints to go through life.* ####
Regarding my personal and professional background, that is a good example of this succession of ups and downs, <u>I use a simple motto as my main waypoint, like **a mantra which sum-up my approach for problem solving**</u> :

##  My personal mantra  ##
> *If there is no solution, there is no problem.* --- Unknown

I can't remember how this came to my knowledge, so I don't know who I can credit for that quote! [Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=If%20there%20is%20no%20solution,%20there%20is%20no%20problem) hesitate between Buddhism (Dalai Lama) and Dadaism (Marcel Duchamp)...

#### How those simple words can affect a life path ####

Anyways, it has driven my decisions and choices at least thorough the past 15 years, with quite a good success :

 - When I switched from nurse studies to IT field for health concerns,
 - When I left my native area to work on Paris (France) following a dark year,
 - When my wife and I chose to emigrate to Canada at the very moment we felt that our lives needed to level-up  !

From my point of view, using this mantra as a decisional leverage, combinated with a solid professional expertise, is a good way to find relevant (sometimes  out-of-bounds) solutions to :
 
 - some network and security designs that needs to be efficient with the lowest building and recurring fees,
 - blocking points you can face when you integrate some unknown technology,
 - the most critical issues when all well-known solving paths can't apply.

## Make those words yours ! ##
As it worked for me, I have no doubt that some of you will find out that this "mantra" makes sense !
And if it can help you to complete your daily challenges as from now, I will be more than pleased :)
