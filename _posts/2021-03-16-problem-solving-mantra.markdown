## Life is a succession of challenges...
#### ...that we face on a daily basis:
- Most of these challenges are easy to overcome and are completed in a matter of seconds.
- But some may appear overwhelming and take much longer to resolve.

#### *With this understanding, we can agree that everyone needs some waypoints to navigate through life.*
Drawing from my personal and professional background, which exemplifies this succession of ups and downs, I use a simple motto as my main waypointâ€”a **mantra that sums up my approach to problem-solving.**

## My Personal Mantra
> *If there is no solution, there is no problem.*  
> --- Unknown

I can't recall how I first encountered this quote, so I don't know who to credit! [Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=If%20there%20is%20no%20solution,%20there%20is%20no%20problem) suggests it could be attributed to either Buddhism (Dalai Lama) or Dadaism (Marcel Duchamp).

#### How these simple words can shape a life path

This mantra has guided my decisions and choices since at least the early 2000s, with notable success:

- When I switched from nursing studies to the IT field due to health concerns.
- When I left my hometown to work in Paris (France) after a difficult year.
- When my wife and I decided to emigrate to Canada at a pivotal moment in our lives.

#### How those simple words can help on a working routine

From my perspective, using this mantra as a decision-making tool, combined with solid professional expertise, is an effective way to find relevant (and sometimes unconventional) solutions to:

- Network and security designs that need to be efficient while minimizing costs.
- Challenges encountered when integrating unfamiliar technologies.
- Critical issues where conventional solutions do not apply.

## Make These Words Yours!
As this mantra has worked for me, I have no doubt that some of you will find it meaningful too.

If it helps you tackle your daily challenges starting today, I will be more than pleased! ðŸ˜Š
