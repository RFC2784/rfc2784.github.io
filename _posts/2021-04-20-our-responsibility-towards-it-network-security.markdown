IT security is the way to **protect IT components <u>from every kind of threat</u>** :

 - It has to be considered as **a long-term insurance**, 
 - It must cover **physical infrastructure <u>as much as</u> logical infrastructure**.

####IT Network : the key component to secure ?####

With a strong predominance of Internet-related uses, **network infrastructure must be considered the <u>backbone of computer technology</u>.**

In addition to **strong reliability** requirements, more and more abilities were added to network architectures the time passing by, such as **<u>content inspection/protection layers against cyberthreats</u>.**

## Everyone must be concerned about IT Network security. Why ? How ?##

From the decision makers to the operations technicians, passing by IT Network architects, everyone should be aware of the importance of securing IT Network.

As mentioned upper regarding a more global scope, **IT Network Security in Professional Computing must be considered <u>a long-term insurance</u>**, that means :

 - **A good knowledge of the scope to protect :**
  - *"<u>Every fuzzy need leads to a very specific bullshit</u>"* : in less flowery language, security requires accuracy.
  - **Security expectations evolve over time, and require some adjustments** regarding configuration and service contracts.
 - **Investments costs awareness :**
  - Investing on network devices hardware and/or perpetual software licensing is a thing, considering that lifecycle policy to follow for such in order to keep a state-of-art infrastructure is about 5 years.
 - **Operational costs awareness :**
  - Typically, <u>threat prevention features</u> embedded in core network devices <u>are tied to **time-limited licenses**</u>. Those costs are  <u>cumulative with hardware or basic software support contracts</u>.
  - In some cases, [99.99% SLA](https://uptime.is/four-nines) and 24/7 support is a must-have,
  - **<u>higher the security requirements are, higher the recurring costs will be.</u>**
