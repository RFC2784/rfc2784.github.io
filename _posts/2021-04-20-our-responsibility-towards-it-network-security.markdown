## What is Information Technology (IT)?  
![Information Technology (IT)](https://www.reau.ca/content/images/20210417071742-it.jpg){: style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 400px;"}

In a nutshell, **anything related to computing technology is a component of IT**.

### IT in Home Computing: Some Components  
![IT in Home Computing](https://www.reau.ca/content/images/20210417071216-home-computing.jpg){: style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 400px;"}

*Non-exhaustive list:*  
- Smartphones  
- Tablets  
- Laptops / Desktops  
- Smart objects used for home automation (bulbs, doorbells, thermostats, etc.)  
- Internet connection and ways to use it (WiFi, cables).  

### IT in Professional Computing: Some Components

*Non-exhaustive list:*  
- All components involved in Home Computing  
- Datacenters  
- Servers, hypervisors, storage arrays, etc.  
- Routers, switches, firewalls, etc.  
- Websites, applications  
- Public or private customer data  

## What about IT Security in Professional Computing?

IT security is the way to **protect IT components against every kind of threat**:  
- It has to be considered as **a long-term insurance**.  
- It must cover **physical infrastructure as much as logical infrastructure**.  

### IT Network: The Key Component to Secure?

With a strong predominance of Internet-related uses, **network infrastructure must be considered the backbone of computer technology**.

In addition to **strong reliability** requirements, more and more abilities have been added to network architectures over time, such as **content inspection/protection layers against cyberthreats**.

## Everyone Must Be Concerned About IT Network Security. Why? How?

From decision-makers to operations technicians, passing by IT Network architects, everyone should be aware of the importance of securing IT Networks.

As mentioned earlier regarding a more global scope, **IT Network Security in Professional Computing must be considered a long-term insurance**, which means:  
- **A good knowledge of the scope to protect:**  
  - *"Every fuzzy need leads to a very specific bullshit"*â€”in less flowery language, security requires accuracy.  
  - **Security expectations evolve over time and require adjustments** regarding configuration and service contracts.  

- **Investment cost awareness:**  
  - Investing in network device hardware and/or perpetual software licensing is one thing, but consider that the lifecycle policy to maintain a state-of-the-art infrastructure is about 5 years.  

- **Operational cost awareness:**  
  - Typically, **threat prevention features** embedded in core network devices **are tied to time-limited licenses**. These costs are **cumulative with hardware or basic software support contracts**.  
  - In some cases, [99.99% SLA](https://uptime.is/four-nines) and 24/7 support is a must-have.  
  - **The higher the security requirements, the higher the recurring costs will be.**
