# Why talking about diversity in such context ? #
If you live in Canada, or aware of IT newsfeeds, you certainly heard about the major outage Rogers Telecommunication faced on early July 2022.
At the early stages of this event, I was puzzle that such outage led to service interruption for critical application such Interac payment platform or a bunch of Canadian government services web portals.

To be honest, I can't imagine that related decision makers did not apply fully the diversity principle at the stage of solution designs.

# What do I mean about diversity principle ? #
Among all lessons learned as a problem solver, then as a network solutions designer, one of the most significant is **not to underestimate the importance to apply diversity as a balance factor between redundancy and security on an technological solution design** :

- The more bigger the underlying business organization is, the most diverse the solution must be,
- It must prevail in each decision taken to ideate and initiate an integration project.


# Diversity principle by the exemple : Interac network connectivity #
## Good example : my findings about Interac platform Internet transit connectivity ##
## Bad example : my assumptions about the remaining items of Interac platform network solution desigm ##
## Possible remediation plan by applying diversity principle on such context ##
