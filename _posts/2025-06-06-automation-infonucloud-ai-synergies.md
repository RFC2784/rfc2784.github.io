  <img src="/content/images/ot_trsf_en.svg" alt="Industrial Transformation through IT Integration" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
</picture>

The exponential integration of IT into the OT mix represents a transformation of considerable magnitude for numerous industrial sectors worldwide. This trend is characterized by the integration of increasingly complex IT systems at the heart of production processes.

At the same time, this computerization is gaining importance in the management and supervision of critical infrastructure. Energy networks, water treatment facilities, and road, rail, air or maritime networks increasingly depend on IT systems for constant monitoring, precise control and real-time optimization of flows.

Computerization is also transforming service delivery. Telecommunications, financial services and logistics rely on high-performance IT platforms for data management, security, speed and optimization of operations and supply chain.

The massive integration of IT into physical operations leads to a convergence between IT and OT. Real-time data from infrastructure and processes are analyzed by powerful systems, transforming this data into decision-making information to improve efficiency, guide strategies and anticipate maintenance. This convergence offers unprecedented possibilities to improve operational efficiency through resource optimization, increased productivity through automation and finer, more adaptable process control, enabling greater customization.

Finally, this convergence between IT and operational technologies proves to be a powerful catalyst for innovation. The intelligent exploitation of collected data and advanced task automation pave the way for the development of new products with enhanced functionality, novel services meeting emerging needs and disruptive business models challenging established practices. This transformation, driven by the digital transformation of operational processes, is therefore an essential driver of economic growth in an ever-evolving industrial landscape.

# Automation, Cloud Computing and AI: Brief Overview
## Automation: From Fundamentals to Advanced Systems
### Foundations of Modern Automation

</picture>

Technology has always promised to simplify human life. Paradoxically, its applications usually require systems composed of processes with varying complexity. Similarly, each process is a sum of more or less complex tasks, whose execution requires human intervention.

Modern automation aims to improve productivity while minimizing errors due to manual interactions by replacing humans in executing all or part of these tasks.

### Basics of IT Automation

  <source srcset="/content/images/automation_evo_en.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)">
  <img src="/content/images/automation_evo_en.svg" alt="Evolution of Automation in IT" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
</picture>
In the context of current IT, automation initially enabled the rationalization of basic administrative tasks through simple and effective scripts. The continuous improvement of scripting languages like Python, PowerShell, and Bash, combined with the proliferation of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), has paved the way for automating processes previously considered complex and time-consuming. These processes now include user access management, IT infrastructure configuration and deployment, processing and analysis of large data volumes, and implementation of robust sensitive data protection measures. Automation has even reached a level of sophistication allowing end-to-end workflow orchestration, integrating various applications and systems to achieve complex business objectives.

Among basic automation systems implemented in IT, we commonly find:

* **Schedule programming**, which allows executing specific tasks at predefined times. It is notably used for:
  * Software update management across IT systems
  * Enterprise data lifecycle management (backup, archiving, deletion)
* **Pattern filtering**, which triggers specific actions based on patterns listed in a definition database. This type of automation is frequently used for:
  * Chatbots limited to simple interactions, found in FAQs or e-commerce sites
  * Threat prevention systems (antivirus, antimalware)
  * Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

## Cloud Computing: The Engine of Digital Transformation
In the span of 20 years, the IT sector has seen the rise and widespread adoption of what we call cloud computing.

Where companies and organizations were previously constrained to finance the purchase, implementation, operational maintenance, evolution, and obsolescence management of increasingly complex and therefore massive IT solutions, they have been offered the possibility to switch to "As a Service" consumption models. These services are offered remotely by third-party providers and used by clients to complement or replace pre-existing solutions.
