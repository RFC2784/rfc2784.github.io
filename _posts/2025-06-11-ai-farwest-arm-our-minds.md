![Arming our minds to interact with AI](/content/images/ai_farwest.jpg){: style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}

*As we integrate more and more advanced AI capabilities into computer systems, and as we talk about a revolution in the world of work, I get a sense of déjà vu… It seems that in the face of technological advances, humanity invariably repeats the same patterns, without learning from past experiences.*

Following up on my previous post ([Automation, Cloud Computing, and AI: Current State & Synergies](https://www.reau.ca/2025/06/06/automation-infonucloud-ai-synergies.html)), I'd like to analyze **how AI and automation are reshaping our world in unprecedented ways**. This article aims to highlight the approaches that, in my view, should be adopted to support the population during this evolution, particularly by **addressing ethical issues, training, and educational reforms**.

# A Job Market More Disrupted Than Ever

Let's be clear about one thing: <u>basic automation initially made it possible to automate the most repetitive, tedious tasks</u>. We have experienced the consequences of this evolution throughout the last half-century, especially in the industrial sector. This period was marked by mass layoffs and the **sharp decline of many low-skilled job categories, sometimes to the point of their disappearance**. These economic trends have long been documented by organizations like the OECD, the IMF, and by economists analyzing deindustrialization and automation since the 1970s-1980s.

But today, **with the arrival of advanced AI** (deep learning, machine learning, and especially these generative AIs capable of processing large volumes of data), **we are facing a true paradigm shift**. It's no longer just simple tasks, but **jobs that were previously protected, requiring thought and decision-making**, that **are now affected**.

We are living through a profound transformation of the job market, a revolution where advanced automation and artificial intelligence (AI) are redefining our future at a dizzying speed.

Faced with what I feel is **a true technological "Far West,"** where tools of incredible power are thrown into our laps, almost with the message ***'go on, figure it out yourself,'*** it is imperative to <u>reaffirm the prevalence of critical and ethical human intelligence through a radical transformation of education</u>.

# A Stunning "Far West" with a Whiff of Intellectual Resignation

The emergence of tools like ChatGPT has been stunning, producing an endless stream of increasingly relevant content, bordering on the extraordinary. But this fascination must not hide a reality: ***generative AIs arrived as if no one saw it coming***.

Ethical and legal questions abound. I'm talking about lawsuits from artists or Getty Images against Stability AI/Midjourney, from authors against OpenAI, or from The New York Times against OpenAI/Microsoft… <u>How can we ignore that the training data doesn't come from nowhere?</u> Copyright infringement lawsuits are multiplying because petabytes of data have been scraped without the consent of the rights holders.

More insidiously, **we observe that the general population consumes all this content as a finished product**, an end in itself. [In the educational field, the observation is sometimes grim…](https://www.404media.co/teachers-are-not-ok-ai-chatgpt/) Young minds no longer even make the effort to think: they regurgitate AI-generated content "as is," without real appropriation. <u>However, one of the fundamental principles of human intelligence is understanding</u>: to be able to appropriate concepts, a human being must understand what they are doing, reading, watching, or listening to.

# Education: Our Compass in the AI Storm

This situation reveals **a persistent gap between school education systems and current technological challenges**. And this is not new, my personal experience attests to it: I never had a single school program that truly taught me the basics of computer science. I quickly learned to master computers on my own because the school was always one step behind. And that was 30 years ago!

<u>Today, with AI, this gap is no longer acceptable</u>. Fear also comes from a lack of knowledge. It is therefore vital to:

1. **Train teaching staff to anchor the basics of computer science from an early age:** Even if younger generations are comfortable with screens, we must not confuse familiarity with understanding.
   Integrating computer skills and computational thinking into other subjects taught in primary and secondary school has been more or less established in OECD countries over the last 10 years.
   Some member countries have also chosen to make computer science mandatory in the curriculum, such as with the "Key Stages" in the United Kingdom for 5-14 year olds or with "Sciences Numériques et Technologiques" in France taught in the "Seconde" year (equivalent to Grade 10).
   However, the implementation of these ambitious programs faces a major obstacle: <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><u>how can we expect teachers to instill these concepts if their own level of digital literacy is insufficient?</u></span> This is a constant challenge, and we will see in the following chapters how continuing education and mutual support can address it.
2. **Demystify AI:** Explain its history, at least in broad strokes, from the famous Turing test to today's complex algorithms. Show how we got here. <u>And to make it concrete, we could, for example, organize sessions where students learn about the functioning of the AIs they use every day</u>. *How does YouTube's recommendation system work? Instagram's or TikTok's news feed algorithm?*
3. **Train for ethical and responsible use of emerging technologies, and drastically strengthen critical thinking:** These skills, far from being obsolete, are becoming <u>the foundation of our ability to interact intelligently with AI, to question it, and not to be totally dependent on, let alone fooled by, its results</u>.
   Beyond specific IT-related courses, this is also where subjects often disliked by students take on their full meaning.
   Many have felt a more or less profound boredom in classes on civics, critical thinking, or philosophy in the broad sense. But personally, if I hadn't taken these courses, I wouldn't have the capacity for perspective that is increasingly necessary in the face of technological challenges. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><u>These skills are essential to ensure that humanity's interest is always at the heart of every decision.</u></span>

</picture>

# The Responsibility of Organizations: More Than an Option, a Necessity
The effort must not rest solely on the education system. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><u>Companies and public administrations must actively commit to training their staff</u></span> in computer use, basic IT security principles, and the use of AI, through real awareness and continuing education programs. They must also <u>cultivate an inclusive work environment</u> that promotes intra-team and inter-team mutual aid, particularly through the implementation of mentoring programs or the establishment of communities of practice.

</picture>
*Some innovative companies are already integrating dedicated cybersecurity and AI training into their continuing education curriculum, while also training managers to foster this inclusive work environment, encouraging their teams to improve and help each other in this growing field.*

This is crucial because, in the future, humans could become a sort of manager of advanced AI chains, like collaborative robots or complex decision-support algorithms. Not providing training is clearly risking misuse. <u>There could be a mismatch between available skills and job requirements, leaving staff overwhelmed</u>. **<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Doing nothing promotes the planned obsolescence of many categories of workers.</span>**

**A lack of maturity in AI and cybersecurity is already causing costly mistakes and exposing organizations to major security risks:**

* The example of the billions invested and significant losses of General Motors' Cruise subsidiary reported in the article [GM to retreat from robotaxis and stop funding its Cruise autonomous vehicle unit (NPR - Dec. 2024)](https://www.npr.org/2024/12/11/g-s1-37700/gm-to-retreat-from-robotaxis-and-stop-funding-its-cruise-autonomous-vehicle-unit) illustrates the financial challenges of large-scale AI projects.
* According to [Cisco's 2025 Cybersecurity Readiness Index report](https://newsroom.cisco.com/c/dam/r/newsroom/en/us/interactive/cybersecurity-readiness-index/2025/documents/2025_Cisco_Cybersecurity_Readiness_Index.pdf), nearly 9 out of 10 organizations worldwide have experienced at least one AI-related cybersecurity incident in the last 12 months, while **only 30% of them have a sufficient degree of maturity to cope with it.**
* [The 'fake CFO' fraud via deepfake video conference, costing a firm US$25 million in early 2024](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/arup-deepfake-scam-loss-hong-kong-intl-hnk), strikingly illustrates the ability of cyber threats, combined with sophisticated AI, to multiply financial losses exponentially.

**It is therefore essential that companies and public administrations take their responsibilities seriously and invest in the development of their staff's skills and resilience**; this is indispensable for their success and adaptation to this new environment shaped by AI.

# Let's Foster Inclusive Community Initiatives

To properly prepare everyone for the changes caused by AI and automation, we must do more than just help those who are working or in school. There are many people, such as <u>retirees, the unemployed, and those who cannot follow traditional training, or those who are underrepresented in technology fields</u>, who **need special assistance**.
<picture>

<source srcset="/content/images/community_matters_d_en.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
  <source srcset="/content/images/community_matters_en.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)">
  <img src="/content/images/community_matters_en.svg" alt="Facilitating Digital Transformation Through Community Engagement" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
</picture>
**It is super important to encourage and support local groups and charitable organizations** that want to simply explain what computer science, AI, and automation are, talk about the challenges, and provide practical training to become familiar with these technologies, with respect for inclusion and diversity. These groups can do many different things, such as <u>workshops or conferences open to all</u>, or <u>projects where people learn together and where more experienced people help others</u>.

*I have in mind the example of [Technovation](https://www.technovationmontreal.com/organizationen), a wonderful global initiative that aims to develop technology and entrepreneurship skills in girls aged 8 to 18. This program encourages girls' empowerment, gives them access to female role models and mentoring in the tech field, and prepares them to become leaders and innovators in a sector where women are still underrepresented.*

*I also think of [this situation](https://www.lesoleil.com/actualites/actualites-locales/la-capitale/2024/09/26/44-ipads-pour-compenser-la-fermeture-dune-caisse-desjardins-QRCQRI6CZJB2ZIOGJ4NGOFCVOU/) where a mayor, faced with the computerization of local services, partnered with a local organization to train seniors in his community on new technologies, and even offered to provide them with iPads to compensate for the closure of a bank branch.*

  <img src="/content/images/support_community_en.svg" alt="Supporting Community Tech Initiatives" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
</picture>
**Donations to charitable organizations** working on such initiatives, whether it's obsolete computer equipment or money, **are relatively common ways to show support**, especially because they are partially tax-deductible (e.g., Canada, France, USA). But money or equipment without the human power to transmit knowledge is not very useful… Whether by personal choice or through pro-bono programs offered by some companies and administrations, **volunteering actions to support these initiatives should be much more widespread and encouraged to close the inexorably widening technological gap!**

***By using the strengths of communities, using what we have locally, and encouraging intergenerational exchanges, <u>we can create a great learning network open to all</u>**. This will allow everyone to develop the skills needed to navigate a rapidly changing world, to take advantage of the opportunities offered by AI and automation, and to participate fully in tomorrow's society*.

# Let's Generalize Responsible AI Initiatives

The meteoric rise of advanced artificial intelligence inevitably raises the question of ethics around AI, and calls for the urgent implementation of "**Responsible AI**." <u>But what do we mean by "responsible"?</u>
<picture>

<source srcset="/content/images/resp_ai_d_en.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
  <source srcset="/content/images/resp_ai_en.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)">
  <img src="/content/images/resp_ai_en.svg" alt="Foundations of Responsible AI" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
</picture>
First, it is about **defining a framework, a governance that frames the use of data**: what type of data can be used, by what type of AI, and under what specific conditions? This implies scrupulous respect for copyright and intellectual property, to prevent models from becoming plunderers of content protected by intellectual property rights.

As early as 2016, the report ["Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence" (October 2016)](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/whitehouse_files/microsites/ostp/NSTC/preparing_for_the_future_of_ai.pdf) also recommended that the US government explore how to make high-quality federal datasets more accessible to the public and AI researchers, while protecting privacy and security. The main principles of responsible AI must ensure that its development and deployment are carried out **with full transparency and in accordance with our fundamental values**, rather than letting us navigate this "Far West" where anything seems permissible.

Beyond just data, responsible <u>AI also concerns the ethics regarding AI itself</u>: **how do we use it within governments, companies, and administrations?** It is crucial to define how it is implemented for specific tasks, **ensuring that the human being is always the one who must keep their hand on the tiller**.

Finally, responsible AI cannot exist without <u>a massive effort to support people in adopting and understanding these tools</u>, so they can learn to use them ethically and logically, always retaining their critical judgment.

# In Conclusion

Automation, cloud computing, and advanced AIs have contributed to a profound transformation of our world. **These technologies, by mutually reinforcing each other, open up unprecedented possibilities for efficiency and innovation, <u>but also raise major challenges</u>.**

The rise of AIs, in particular, requires special attention. While they can automate complex tasks and augment our capabilities, they pose significant ethical and legal questions. Transparency in data use, respect for copyright, and ensuring human control are essential.

**Faced with this technological revolution, education, training, and inclusive communities are more crucial than ever.** It is imperative to anchor the basics of computer science from an early age, to demystify AI, and to train for ethical and responsible use. Public and private organizations must also invest in the training and resilience of their staff so they can adapt to this new environment. It is just as crucial to foster an ecosystem where digital skills are shared so that everyone, regardless of age or background, feels able to navigate the world of AI and automation.

Ultimately, like every major technological advance, AI can be a formidable ally. And like any technological advance, this requires a massive investment in human intelligence—our ability to understand, to critique, and to act ethically. **It is time to take back control of our technological destiny so that this wave carries us toward a better future rather than overwhelming us.**

# To Go Further

As luck would have it, an [Introducing the OECD's AI Capacity Indicators](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/introducing-the-oecd-ai-capability-indicators_be745f04-en.html)<sup>[1]</sup> report was published online a week before my article!

The result of five years of in-depth work with the help of more than 50 experts, these beta indicators aim to "[...] assess and compare advances in AI relative to human capabilities" and "[...] to provide a clear framework for policymakers to understand the potential impacts of AI on education, work, public affairs and private life."

Definitely a reading recommendation 😉
